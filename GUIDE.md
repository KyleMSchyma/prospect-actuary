# Prospect Actuary: Plain-English Guide

This guide explains what each Prospect Actuary model predicts, what the final model is,
what drives it, and how to explain it to someone who doesn't do statistics. The three
public boards are the [Pre-Draft Player Grades](https://kylemschyma.github.io/prospect-actuary/pre-draft/)
(section 9), the [Post-Draft Player Grades](https://kylemschyma.github.io/prospect-actuary/post-draft/)
(section 10) and the [Dynasty Value Board](https://kylemschyma.github.io/prospect-actuary/dynasty/)
(section 11). The other sections describe the research models those boards grew out of.

## The one-paragraph version

These models try to answer one question at three moments in a young player's career:
"How likely is he to become a useful fantasy starter in his first three NFL seasons?"
Before the draft we only have college stats. On draft night we also know where he was
picked. After his rookie year and his second year we know how the NFL actually used him.
The big lesson: **each new piece of real information beats the clever stuff that came
before it.** Draft position beats college stats, and a player's actual NFL usage beats
draft position.

## Shared ideas (explain these once)

- **Tiers.** "Hitting" means at least one season in years 1-3 inside a tier. For QBs, RBs
  and TEs the tiers are top 8, top 16 and top 24 at the position. For WRs they are top 12,
  top 24 and top 36 (more WRs start in fantasy lineups).
- **Fair testing.** Each draft class is predicted only with classes whose results were
  already known at the time, like a forecaster who is not allowed to peek at the future.
  This is called rolling-origin testing, and it's the honest score.
- **Always compare to a simple benchmark.** Every model is measured against "just use the
  draft pick." If a fancy model can't beat that, we say so.
- **Elastic net.** The workhorse model. Think of it as a regression that is told "use as
  few inputs as you can, and keep their effects modest." It keeps the model from
  over-reacting to quirks in a small sample, which matters when there are only about 14
  draft classes to learn from.
- **Probabilities that make sense together.** The models are built so a player's chance
  of a top-8 season can never be higher than his chance of a top-24 season.

## 1. Rookie draft-time models (WR, QB, RB, TE)

**What they predict.** For each drafted player: fantasy points over his first three
seasons, his chance of reaching each tier, and a "finish score" (his three yearly
position ranks added up, lower is better).

**Final model in plain words.** An elastic net that starts from draft position (the log of
the pick number, because the gap between picks 1 and 10 matters far more than between 150
and 160) and lets college production, age, athletic testing, recruiting and the team's
open opportunity nudge the projection up or down.

**Key drivers.**

- Draft pick, by a wide margin, at every position.
- WR: younger breakout age and younger draft age, career receiving yards, recruiting.
- QB: completion rate, low interception rate, touchdown rate.
- RB: vacated touches on the new team, early declaring.
- TE: best college "dominator" season (share of team receiving), a fast 40 and 3-cone.

**The honest result.** Once you know the draft pick, college and combine data add
nothing you can measure. For QB total points and the RB top-24 model, adding them made
results slightly worse. NFL teams already bake the college film and stats into where they
pick a player.

**How to explain it.** "NFL front offices are the best scouts we have. Their draft pick
already contains almost everything the college numbers say, so the pick is the
projection. The college stats only help a little at the margins."

## 2. Tier ladder and finish score

**What they predict.** The chances of the player's best season landing in each tier
(for example WR1, WR2, WR3), with the chances nested so they always add up sensibly.

**Final model in plain words.** An ordered model: picture a ladder with rungs at top 8,
top 16 and top 24. One score per player says how high up the ladder he's likely to
climb. The two-step finish score first asks "will he ever be a fantasy starter?" and then
"if so, how good?"

**How to explain it.** "Instead of one number, you get a ladder: a 30% shot at elite, a
50% shot at being a solid starter, a 70% shot at being at least a flex play."

## 3. Value score and Day-3 "hidden talent"

**What it measures.** How much more the college-only model likes a player than his draft
slot does. Used to build Day-3 stash lists.

**The honest result.** It's borderline at best. For WRs the most-liked third of Day-3
picks beat their slot by about 50 points over three years, but the uncertainty range
crosses zero. For RBs it went the wrong way. Simply taking the earliest Day-3 picks found
more future starters than the college "hidden" score did. Tyreek Hill, Puka Nacua and
Hunter Renfrow all ranked near the bottom of their Day-3 class on college data.

**How to explain it.** "Stash lists are lottery tickets. College stats can't reliably
find the late-round star."

## 4. Year-2 model (after the rookie season)

**What it predicts.** The chance of a tier season in years 2-3, using how the NFL actually
used him as a rookie: snaps, target or touch share, late-season role, efficiency.

**Final model in plain words.** An elastic net on rookie usage, compared against "draft
pick plus rookie fantasy points."

**Key drivers.** Target share and snap share (especially over the last six games), plus
rookie points. For QBs: low interception rate, late-season starts, accuracy over expected.
For RBs: receiving share, snap share, yards per carry.

**The result.** This is the strongest signal in the whole project. For QBs the usage
model clearly beats rookie points alone. For WRs and RBs it ties them. For TEs, rookie
points alone are slightly better. After one season, the rookie-year Day-3 stars (Hill,
Renfrow, Mooney, St. Brown, Nacua) all show up near the top of their class.

**How to explain it.** "One NFL season tells you more than three college seasons. A
rookie who played most snaps and drew a big target share is a buy, even if his fantasy
points were meh."

## 5. Year-3 model (after year 2)

**What it predicts.** The chance of a tier season in year 3.

**Final model in plain words.** The same usage approach with year-1 and year-2 data.

**The result.** Year-2 fantasy points dominate at every position (QB top-24 accuracy about
0.99 on the AUC scale). Usage ties points, but it's useful for reading the board: rising
target share and late-season snaps flag year-3 risers (for TEs the biggest drivers are
target share and WOPR, a blend of target and air-yards share).

**How to explain it.** "By year three, what he did last year is most of the story. Usage
trends tell you who's trending up or down inside that story."

## 6. Undrafted free agents

**What we found.** Undrafted hits are rare (RB and TE about 4% vs 11-12% for rounds 4-7;
no undrafted QB reached the top 24). The college model doesn't find them; the rookie-usage
model does once they play. Adding them to training changes no conclusions.

## 7. Buy / sell lists

**What they are.** Simple rules on top of the boards. A "buy" is a player the usage model
likes more than his fantasy points suggest (big snap or target share, late-season growth).
A "sell" is one whose points ran ahead of his usage (touchdown-heavy, falling late-season
snaps). "Sell" doesn't mean bad; it means the market may be paying for points the role
doesn't support.

## 8. Pre-draft (college-only) model and class grades

**What it predicts.** Before anyone is drafted, each college player's chance of a top,
top-two and any-tier season in his first three NFL years. It's trained on every
draft-eligible college player (about 900 to 2,800 per position), so "never made the NFL"
counts as a miss. Uses no draft pick and no combine.

**Final model in plain words.**

- QB, RB, TE: an elastic net on college production, age, recruiting and conference level.
- WR: a plain logistic regression on five inputs (receiving yards, dominator share, years
  out of high school, recruiting rating, Power 5). It tied the elastic net, and the
  simpler model wins ties.
- Random forests, gradient boosting (xgboost) and an average of models were all tested
  and lost. With only a few dozen hits per position, simpler models are more reliable.

**Key drivers.** Youth (fewer years out of high school), recruiting rating, Power 5, and
the position's production: QB accuracy, TD rate and low INT rate; RB touchdown share and
receiving; WR receiving yards and dominator share; TE yards per team pass attempt and
receiving share.

**FCS adjustment.** FCS stats are shrunk toward an FBS scale. Players who transferred from
FCS to FBS saw their production share drop more than FBS-to-FBS transfers, which gives a
factor of about 0.69 for receiving and rushing and 0.79 for passing. Conference labels
were tested as extra inputs (including a credibility-weighted conference effect) and did
not help.

**Class grades.** Add up the expected tier hits of each class's top prospects (QB 12, RB
20, WR 32, TE 15) and grade against 2010-2023 (A = top 10%, F = bottom 10%). Current:
2027 projected A− overall, 2026 F, 2025 A, 2024 C−. Class grades track reality modestly
(correlation about 0.5 for the overall grade), so trust the overall grade more than any
single position's.

**How to explain it.** "It's a scouting report built only from the box score and recruiting
rankings. It finds real signal (it ranks future hits well above average) but the NFL draft
still knows more."

## 9. All-time pre-draft player grades

**What it is.** A letter grade (A+ to F) for every drafted QB, RB, WR and TE from 2010-2026,
plus the top 2027 prospects, from the college-only model. Historical grades are scored by
a model that never saw that class, so they're honest.

**The result.** A-range players hit about 59% of the time, B about 31%, C and below about
14%. The grade separates the top well but not the bottom (C, D and F hit at similar
rates). Draft slot is still more accurate, and the grade only adds to draft slot for QBs.
Famous misses: Johnny Manziel (A+), N'Keal Harry (A+); famous low grades that hit: Josh
Allen (F), Cooper Kupp (F), Tyreek Hill (D), George Kittle (D).

**How to explain it.** "An A means the college résumé looks like past hits. It's a
strong flag at the top, not a guarantee, and a low grade doesn't rule a player out."

## 10. All-time post-draft player grades

**What it is.** The same A+ to F board for every drafted player from 2010-2026, but built
from the post-draft version of each position model (college profile plus draft pick and
landing spot). It sits next to the pre-draft grade, so you can see how much draft capital
moved each player and each class. 2027 isn't on it because nobody has been drafted.

**The result.** Post-draft A-range players hit 69% of the time, B 35%, C 9% and D/F 4%.
Unlike the pre-draft grade, it separates the bottom too. It also ranks players within a
class better (average rank correlation 0.49-0.61 vs 0.31-0.45). Big risers include Carson
Wentz (F to A-), Doug Martin (D to A) and Travis Kelce (C to A-); big fallers are mostly
late picks with strong college numbers, such as Alex Collins (A- to D).

**How to explain it.** "The pre-draft grade is what the college stats say. The post-draft
grade adds what the NFL said with its pick. When they disagree, history sides with the
pick more often, which is why a pre-draft A who goes in round 6 usually fades."

## 11. Dynasty Value Board (every active player)

**What it is.** A dynasty value for every active QB, RB, WR and TE, drafted or undrafted,
that combines how productive a player is with how long he will stay useful. It also gives a
trade value scale, a 3-season "win-now" value and the expected number of startable seasons
left.

**The final model.** It's priced like a life annuity. For each of the next 10 seasons, take
the chance the player is still a "living" fantasy asset, times the points he's expected to
score above the startable line (QB24, RB24, WR36, TE12), discounted 15% a year, and add
them up. A career "ends" after two straight seasons below the line, with a free pass for the
rookie year. The survival chance is the average of a discrete-time logistic hazard GLM and a
survival random forest. The points come from the average of a Tweedie GLM (the insurance
"pure premium" model) and a random forest. Kaplan-Meier and a Cox model were fit too. Cox
lost because its key assumption (effects stay constant over time) clearly fails.

**The trade value.** Roster spots are limited, so one great player is worth more than two
good ones. The trade value is a curve on overall rank, fit to anchor trades such as
"#1 = #8 + #20", so that sums of trade values are fair trades.

**The result.** On held-out seasons, the value ranked startable players' next three seasons
better than "he'll repeat this year" (rank correlation 0.58 vs 0.46), with about 40% less
error. Once startable, QBs last a median of 5 seasons, WRs 4, and RBs and TEs 3. Two extra
years of age cut a WR's or RB's value by about a quarter but a QB's by only 3%. Because QB24
counts as startable, it's a superflex board, so QBs dominate the top.

**How to explain it.** "It's how an insurer values a pension. Each future season is a
payment, weighted by the chance he's still around to collect it. A star with two years
left and a young player with a long runway can end up worth the same, and the board shows
you which is which."

## Actuarial concepts behind it (SOA ATPA / PA exams)

| If someone asks... | Point to |
|---|---|
| "How do you know it isn't overfit?" | Rolling-origin validation by draft class; fixed benchmark; bootstrap confidence intervals |
| "Why not a fancier model?" | Model comparison (ATPA 4.5): random forest and xgboost lost to a penalized GLM on small samples |
| "Why does the model say what it says?" | Permutation importance, PDP/ICE and SHAP (ATPA 4.3) |
| "What about missing college data?" | Leakage-safe imputation with missing flags (ATPA 3.7a) |
| "Does conference strength matter?" | Credibility / mixed-model test (ATPA 3.3), no gain |
| "Why are probabilities nested?" | Ordered (cumulative logit) models and forced monotone probabilities |
| "How long will a player stay useful?" | Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier, discrete-time hazard GLM, Cox (with the proportional hazards check), survival forest |
| "Why Tweedie for points?" | Many zero seasons plus a long tail, the same shape as insurance pure premium |
| "Why discount future seasons?" | Present value of an annuity: each season is a payment weighted by its survival probability |
